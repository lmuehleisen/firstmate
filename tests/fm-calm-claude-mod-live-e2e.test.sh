#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Opt-in credentialed live regression for the Claude Code Calm mod
# (.claude/mods/firstmate-calm) in a real Claude Code TUI under tmux, mirroring the
# Pi interactive case in tests/fm-calm-pi-extension.test.sh. It proves, against the
# installed Claude Code and the shipped project auto-load path (.claude/skills):
#   1. With CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS unset, the mod is a complete no-op even
#      with the per-home preference already on: no hooks module loads, /calm is not a
#      command, the stock working row shows, and tool rows draw as stock.
#   2. With the flag on, the sailboat replaces the working row and moves, tool rows and
#      an exact operational user row draw at zero height, /calm restores them and
#      persists off, /calm hides them again and persists on, all without a Calm output
#      row in the transcript. The operational rows cover a typed watcher input and an
#      away-mode escalation delivered through the daemon's real inject_msg; Claude Code
#      2.1.277+ removes their U+2063 mark on submit, and the delivered escalation must
#      still classify as away-supervisor.
#   3. `claude --continue` restores the transcript with those rows still hidden.
# The project and FM_HOME are isolated; Claude keeps using its existing managed
# authentication and one trusted temporary folder. A few Haiku turns are submitted.
# shellcheck disable=SC2016 # the model, not this test shell, reads the prompt text
